        <h2>About Ceren.</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Ceren Susuz.
          I was born in Keçiören/ANKARA on March 20, 1997.
          I started my education at Haci Mustafa Tarman Primary School.
          I was always a quiet, calm and hard-working student.
          After my successful primary school life, my high school life started at Meltem College and I continued my
          success there.
          I've never been able to make a decision in this period when I've finished myself thinking about "what I'm
          going to be".
          And I listened to my parents, and I ended up in Computer Engineering.
          I was very impressed when I first met the software with the C programming language and decided that I wanted
          to move forward in this area. I decided I wanted to move forward in this field.
          But I didn't want to continue in this department, where the hardware part was dominant, and I left my school
          to develop myself in the field of software.
          Anadolu University Open Education faculty "Web Design and Coding" department, which is new on the agenda,
          attracted my interest and I registered.
          During this process, I participated in many seminars and took courses in which I will improve myself.
